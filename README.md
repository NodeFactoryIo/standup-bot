# Standup Bot ðŸ¤–
> Discord bot for Scrum daily standups

**THIS BOT IS NOT IN USE ANYMORE**

## How-To:

#### *Disclaimer:* 

This bot is not meant to replace your daily standups outright. It is more of a helper for your meetings. Instead of spending time going around asking the same questions everyday, time can be reserved for more important non-repetitive discussion and help.

### Initial Setup 

[~~**Click Here**~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfr64zoBTAQ) to add the bot to your server. 
> Note that the above requires you to have the **Manage Server** permission in this server  

The bot will then create an entry in the `MongoDB` database for the server, create the text channel `#daily-standups` and send an introduction.

### Commands
> The prefix for this bot is `!`

| `show`  | *Shows standup prompt*                             | `!show`                                 | **_both_**   |                                             |
| `reply` | *Reply to standup prompt*                          | `!reply @<optional_serverId> [message]` | DM           | `optional_server_id`: for multiple standups |
| `view`  | *View your standup response*                       | `!view @<optional_serverId>`            | DM           | `optional_server_id`: for multiple standups |


### Usage
> Standup time is set to `10:30:00 PM EST` every weekday

Anytime before the standup time, added members must DM the bot with the `reply` followed by their message. The bot will then upload this response to the database.    
Come standup time, the bot will create an Embed with all collected member responses *and* will include a `Hooligans` section with mentions of members who did not participate.  
This message will be posted to `#daily-standups`.

After the message has been posted, the bot will delete all member responses, thus members will have to DM for the next standup.

#### Made with

- `Discord.js` and `node-schedule` for cron jobs
- `MongoDB` with `mongoose`
- `Heroku` for hosting
