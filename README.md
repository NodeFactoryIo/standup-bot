# Standup Bot ðŸ¤–
> Discord bot for Scrum daily standups

## How-To:

#### *Disclaimer:* 

This bot is not meant to replace your daily standups outright. It is more of a helper for your meetings. Instead of spending time going around asking the same questions everyday, time can be reserved for more important non-repetitive discussion and help.

### Initial Setup 

1. Fork the repository
2. Configure your Discord API Keys and MongoDB credentials
3. Configure the cadence and duration, and other details of your standups on the `__config__.js` file
4. Add your bot to the server
  > Note that the above requires you to have the **Manage Server** permission in this server  

The bot will then create an entry in the `MongoDB` database for the server, create the text channel `#daily-standups` and send an introduction. Feel free to rename the newly created channel.

### Commands
> The default prefix for this bot is `!`

| `reply` | *Reply to standup prompt*                          | `!reply @<optional_serverId> [message]` | DM           | `optional_server_id`: for multiple standups |
| `view`  | *View your standup response*                       | `!view @<optional_serverId>`            | DM           | `optional_server_id`: for multiple standups |


### Usage
> Standup time and cadence is set through the `config.js` file.

Anytime before the standup time, added members must DM the bot with the `reply` followed by their message. The bot will then upload this response to the database.    
Come standup time, the bot will create an Embed with all collected member responses *and* will include a `Hooligans` section with mentions of members who did not participate.  
This message will be posted to `#daily-standups`.

After the message has been posted, the bot will delete all member responses, thus members will have to DM for the next standup.

#### Made with

- `Discord.js` and `node-schedule` for cron jobs
- `MongoDB` with `mongoose`
